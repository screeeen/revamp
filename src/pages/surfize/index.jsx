Surfize simulates hypothetical battles that occurred in a near past and unknown to the media. Set in random locations, the battles follow archaic gameplay with a twist. Darkness is a palpable value in the game, its retro-palpable and mysterious. Ruled by simple and dark settings, this gameplay narrates hidden extraterrestrial stories in our planet. */}
